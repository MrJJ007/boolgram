### Submission
1. Please fork this repository
2. Please extend this README or add another document that details your project
2. Please email `edward@boolean.co.uk` with a link to your repository

Take the time you need to make something you're proud of but as we're hiring ASAP we'd love to have it back within a week if possible.

### Evaluation
What we will evaluate is
- how you use React
- how you design the layout thinking about the reusability of components
- how you deal with async calls.

### Instructions
We divide the exercise into steps

#### Step 1
Replicate the UI using a hierarchy of components that you find correct for this case. No need to over complicate or over structure.

#### Step 2
Populate the stories section (the one on top with rounded images) making an async call to https://flynn.boolean.careers/exercises/api/boolgram/profiles. No clicks or actions are needed, just display the images

#### Step 3
Populate the feed with content making an async call to this endpoint https://flynn.boolean.careers/exercises/api/boolgram/posts

#### Further
Implement a skeleton screen loading, as you see in the video.

## Extension 

The file App.js acts as the 'main' function and all the aspects of the website are in the components folder. I didn't download / resize any of the images to save time. When doing this actually teaching this or producing this it is important to download and resize the images.
